This repo contains some small JavaScript projects that were built to improve my personal learning.

## Projects

### Pokemon Fetch

A classic first example to understand fetching data with vanilla JavaScript.

### Weather App

A simple page to search for a city's current weather. It was created to understand initial DOM manipulation and more advanced data fetching with JavaScript.
